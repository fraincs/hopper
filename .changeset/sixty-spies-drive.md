"@hopper-ui/components": patch
---

- To ease the transition from Orbiter to Hopper, we want to be able to replace the Lozenge component from Orbiter with the one from Hopper. We have mapped Lozenge variants to their corresponding Badge variants for temporary compatibility.
- Also moved the temporary mapping functions to utils files for maintainability and readability.
