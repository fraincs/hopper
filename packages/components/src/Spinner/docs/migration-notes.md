# Spinner

In orbit/orbiter, the color props used to affect the color of the tracks. In the new version, the color props will only affect the color of the text of the spinner. If you want to change the color of the tracks, the variant prop should be used, offering "default", "white" and "black" options.

the rest remain the same
