Coming from Orbiter, you should be aware of the following changes:

- `onClick` has been renamed to `onPress` to be closer to the [React Aria API](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Button.html#events).
- `Counter` is no longer allowed as a specialized slot.
- `ButtonAsLink` is renamed to `LinkButton`.
- `IconButton` is now integrated into the Button component.
- `as(Button, ReactRouterLink)` is now integrated into the Button component.
