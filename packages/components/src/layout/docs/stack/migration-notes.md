Coming from Orbiter, you should be aware of the following change:

- The default `gap` value has been reduced to `1rem` / `var(--hop-space-stack-md)` from `1.25rem`. Use `UNSAFE_gap="1.25rem"` as a temporary measure during the migration to the Hopper design system. This value should eventually be removed to align with the new design standards.
