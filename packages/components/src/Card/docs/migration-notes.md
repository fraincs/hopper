Coming from Orbiter, you should be aware of the following changes:

- `outline` variant has been renamed `main`.
- `elevated` variant has been renamed `second-level`. You shouldn't use a `second-level` variant without a parent `main` variant.
- `orientation` has been removed.
- `slot` has been removed.
- `fluid` prop has been removed. If you need a fluid Card use an appropriate technique using CSS or StyleProps.
- `size` has been removed. Refer to this [sample](#size).
- The Hopper Card component does not feature custom layouts, you are responsible for implementing the needed layouts.
