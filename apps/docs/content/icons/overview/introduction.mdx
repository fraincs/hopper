Icons are an essential part of building intuitive and engaging user interfaces. Hopper offers a versatile and comprehensive icon system tailored to meet diverse project needs, whether you're building with React or using static assets in other frameworks.

## Using Hopper Icons
Hopper provides two main packages, giving you the flexibility to choose how to integrate icons into your project:

### React Icons Package
Designed specifically for React applications, this package offers all icons as React components.

### SVG Icons Package
Ideal for non-React setups, this package provides raw SVG files.

## Choosing the Right Icons
Hopper icons come in two styles to meet different design needs:

### Icons
- Monochromatic and simple.
- Best suited for functional UI elements like buttons, menus, or actions.


### Rich Icons
- Vibrant and colorful.
- Perfect for decorative purposes or drawing attention to specific elements.
