React Icons are typically utilized alongside the `@hopper-ui/components`. If you want to use them without `@hopper-ui/components`, refer to the [standalone installation](/icons/react-icons/standalone-installation).

## Prerequisites

Follow the `@hopper-ui/components` procedure(coming soon).

## Install packages

<PackageInstallation library="icons" mod="prod" />

## Import Styles

```css title="index.css"
@import "@hopper-ui/icons/index.css";
```

## Start using icons

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { AddIcon } from "@hopper-ui/icons";

export const App = () => (
    <div>
        <span>Hello World!</span>
        <AddIcon size="sm" />
    </div>
);
```
