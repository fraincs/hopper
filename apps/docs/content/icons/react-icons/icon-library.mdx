All icons in the Workleap icon library are available in three predefined sizes. To ensure consistency and clarity, always use the icons at one of these sizes. Avoid resizing icons to dimensions other than the provided options.

To integrate an icon into your project, simply click or tap on it to copy its name instantly.
