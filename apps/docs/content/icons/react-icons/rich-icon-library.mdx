All available rich icons in the icon library are shown below.

Use the correct size for each icon. Icons should be used at their original size.

The color of the rich icons can be changed by using the `variant` prop. The following [decorative colors](/tokens/semantic/color#decorative) are available as variants: `option1` to `option8`.
The following status colors are available as well: `success`, `warning`, `danger`, `information` and `upsell`.

```tsx
<ActionListRichIcon variant="option3" />
```

Click or tap on any icon to copy its name.

<Switcher type="react" iconType="richIcon" />
