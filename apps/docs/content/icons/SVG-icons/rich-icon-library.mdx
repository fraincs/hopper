All rich icons in the Workleap icon library are available in three predefined sizes. To ensure consistency and clarity, always use the icons at one of these sizes. Avoid resizing icons to dimensions other than the provided options.

The color of the rich icons can be changed by using the right CSS Variables.
The following variables are available for your styling needs: `--hop-RichIcon-placeholder-fill`, `--hop-RichIcon-placeholder-background` and `--hop-RichIcon-placeholder-shadow`. You should use the appropriate [decorative semantic tokens](/tokens/semantic/color#decorative) or status semantic tokens. The available options for Rich Icons are `option1` to `option8`, `success`, `warning`, `danger`, `information` and `upsell`.

```css
.actionListRichIcon {
    --hop-RichIcon-placeholder-background: var(--hop-color-decorative-option1);
}
```

To integrate an icon into your project, simply click or tap on it to copy its filename instantly.
