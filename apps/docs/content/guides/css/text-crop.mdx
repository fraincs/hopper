# Text Crop

Every web font includes whitespace above and below the text, while useful in some instances, it can be a problem when vertically centering text or aligning text with other elements. This problem arise when a font has uneven whitespace. This is especially true when using a typeface with a large x-height, like *ABC Favorit*.

[insert a figure showing the problem]

One way to compensate for this is to use a negative margin on the top or bottom of the text. This will crop the whitespace and make the text appear more centered, while preserving the line-height of the text.

## Implementation

It is suggested to apply this technique on a text element, such as a `span`, rather than on it's container, such as a `button` element.

Using a negative margin on the top and bottom of the text will crop the whitespace while preserving line height between lines in a multi-line block of text.

If you need to implement this technique, you can use the following CSS. Keep in mind that each font weight and line-height combinations have their own set of values. You need to use the right token for the job, these are documented in the [tokens section](http://localhost:3000/tokens/semantic/typography).

```tsx title="component.tsx"
<Button className="myButton">
    <span className="off-centered-text">Button</span>
</Button>
```

```css title="component.css"
.off-centered-text {
  font-family: 'ABC Favorit', sans-serif;
  position: relative;
}

.off-centenred-text::before,
.off-centered-text::after {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    width: 0;
    height: 0;
}

.off-centered-text::before {
    /* -0.1875rem */
    margin-bottom: var(--hop-heading-sm-bottom-offset);
}

.off-centered-text::after {
    /* -0.375rem */
    margin-top: var(--hop-heading-sm-top-offset);
}
```

{/* ## Typefaces

Hopper uses two main typefaces: *[Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/)* and *[ABC Favorit](https://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/favorit)*. *ABC Favorit* can look off centered in some cases, in order to counter this you can use top offset and bottom offset tokens exposed by Hopper.

Hopper components already compensate for this issue, when appropriate. You might need to do the same when *ABC Favorit* or *ABC Favorit Mono* is used in a component that have a background color or a border, or to align an heading .
