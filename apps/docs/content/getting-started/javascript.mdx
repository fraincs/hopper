If you are a non-React user you can still benefit from Hopper UI. This guide will help you get started with Hopper UI.

## Tokens

Hopper Tokens are a collection of design tokens that should be used to style your application. [Semantic tokens](/tokens/semantic/color) are available for everyone, where components tokens are designed with non React users in mind.

### Installation

<PackageInstallation library="tokens" mod="prod" />

### Usage

#### CSS

Import the tokens in your project by doing the following:

```css
@import "@hopper-ui/tokens/tokens.css";
```

If your application supports a dark mode, import dark mode tokens as well:

```css
@import "@hopper-ui/tokens/dark/tokens.css";
```

You can now use Hopper tokens in your project by using the following syntax:

```css
.my-class {
    background-color: var(--hop-primary-surface-weak);
}
```

#### Fonts

In order to use Hopper fonts in your project, import the following:

```css
@import "@hopper-ui/tokens/fonts.css";
```

All the necessary font-face declarations are now imported into your project.

## SVG Icons

If your project is not using the React framework, you can use the [SVG icons](/icons/svg/icon-library) directly. You can find the SVG icons in the `@hopper-ui/svg-icons` package.

<PackageInstallation library="svg-icons" mod="prod" />

You can import the SVG directly into your JavaScript file. Keep in mind that if you plan to use SVG icons as components, you'll need to ensure that your bundler is configured to handle SVG parsing appropriately.

```tsx
import alertIcon from "@hopper-ui/svg-icons/alert-24.svg";
```

Alternatively, you can utilize SVG icons within your CSS in the following manner:

```css
.myComponent {
    background-image: url("@hopper-ui/svg-icons/alert-24.svg");
}
```
