This guide will help you get started with Hopper UI. Hopper UI is a Design System that provides a collection of components, [tokens](/tokens/getting-started/introduction), and [icons](/icons/getting-started/introduction) to help you build applications.

Below is the typical installation path, assuming you are using React. If you have particluar needs you can have a look at these pages:

- [Javascript installation](/getting-started/javascript)
- [Individual package installation](/getting-started/individual-packages)

## Installation

### Install packages

Run the following command in your terminal to install the Hopper packages.

<PackageInstallation library="components @hopper-ui/icons @hopper-ui/styled-system react-aria react-aria-components" mod="prod" />

### Configure your application

After installing Hopper UI packages, you must setup a Provider at the root of your application. This is typically in your _index.tsx_ or _app.tsx_, but can vary based on your specific setup.

```jsx
import { HopperProvider } from "@hopper-ui/components";
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <HopperProvider>
    <App />
  </HopperProvider>
);
```

### Import styles

You will also need to import the Hopper styles in your project. You can do this by importing the following CSS files:

```css
@import "@hopper-ui/components/index.css";
@import "@hopper-ui/icons/index.css";
```

You are now ready to use Hopper UI in your project! Need more details? Have a look at the [Individual package installation](/getting-started/individual-packages) page.
