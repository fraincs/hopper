If you need a particluar installation, you can install Hopper UI packages individually.

<FeatureFlag flag="alpha">
    ## Components

    Hopper Components are React Components, if you are using another framework, or React Native, you should use [components tokens](/tokens/overview/introduction) directly when developing your own components.

    ### Installation

    Run one of the following commands in your terminal to install the Hopper Components package.

    <PackageInstallation library="components" mod="prod" />

    ### Usage

    A Provider is required to use Hopper Components. Wrap your application with the HopperProvider component to use our components.

    ```jsx
    import { Button } from "@hopper-ui/components";

    <HopperProvider theme="dark">
        <Button>Hello World</Button>
    </HopperProvider>
    ```
</FeatureFlag>

## Tokens

### Installation

Run the following command to install the tokens package.

<PackageInstallation library="tokens" mod="prod" />

### Usage

Import the tokens in your project by doing the following:

```css title="myfile.css"
@import "@hopper-ui/tokens/tokens.css";
```

If your application supports a dark mode, import dark mode tokens as well:

```css title="myfile.css"
@import "@hopper-ui/tokens/dark/tokens.css";
```

You can now use the tokens in your project by using the following syntax:

```css title="myfile.css"
.my-class {
  background-color: var(--hop-primary-surface-weak);
}
```
#### Fonts

In order to use Hopper fonts in your project, import the following:

```css title="myfile.css"
@import "@hopper-ui/tokens/fonts.css";
```

Font-face declarations are now imported in your project.

Failing to do so would prevent you from using [font family tokens](/tokens/semantic/typography) such as `var(--hop-font-family-primary)`.

*Inter* and *ABC Favorit* variable fonts are used. This allows for a more efficient use of font files, only one font is loaded per typeface, covering all font-weights. Resulting in a smaller bundle size for all.

#### Styled System

We will be releasing a styled system package inspired by styled-components that will allow you to use these tokens as Javascript props at a later time.

## Icons

### Installation

<PackageInstallation library="icons" mod="prod" />

### Usage

You can now use [icons](/icons/react-icons/icon-library) and [rich icons](/icons/react-icons/rich-icon-library) in your project by using the following syntax:

```tsx
import { AddIcon, ConversationRichIcon } from "@hopper-ui/icons";

<AddIcon />
<ConversationRichIcon />
```

#### Standalone Installation

It is recommended to use `@hopper-ui/icons` with `@hopper-ui/components`. The standalone installation procedure is detailed in case you only need the icons, and not the components. This is also the installation process until the components are released.

<PackageInstallation library="icons @hopper-ui/styled-system react-aria-components" mod="prod" />

Import the styles in your project:

```css
@import "@hopper-ui/icons/index.css";
@import "@hopper-ui/styled-system/index.css";
```

Configuring your application is a little different:

```tsx
import { StyledSystemProvider } from "@hopper-ui/styled-system";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!);

root.render(
    <StyledSystemProvider withBodyStyle colorScheme="light">
        <App />
    </StyledSystemProvider>
);
```

Using the icon is the exact same way as with the default package.

```tsx
import { AddIcon } from "@hopper-ui/icons";

<AddIcon />
```

#### React 16 Installation

If you're still using React 16, you need to use the `@hopper-ui/icons-react16` package.

<PackageInstallation library="icons-react16" mod="prod" />

The usage is the same as the default package, you only need to import the icons from a different package.

```tsx
import { AddIcon, ConversationRichIcon } from "@hopper-ui/icons-react16";

<AddIcon />
<ConversationRichIcon />
```
