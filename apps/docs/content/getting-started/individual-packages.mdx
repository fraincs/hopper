If you need a particluar installation, you can install Hopper UI packages individually.

## Components

Hopper Components are React Components, if you are using another framework, or React Native, you should use [components tokens](/tokens/getting-started/introduction) directly when developping your own components.

### Installation

Run one of the following commands in your terminal to install the Hopper Components package.

<PackageInstallation library="components" mod="prod" />

### Usage

A Provider is required to use Hopper Components. Wrap your application with the HopperProvider component to use our components.

```jsx
import { Button } from "@hopper-ui/components";

<HopperProvider theme="dark">
    <Button>Hello World</Button>
</HopperProvider>
```

## Icons

### Installation

<PackageInstallation library="icons" mod="prod" />

### Usage

You can now use [icons](/icons/react-icons/icon-library) and [rich icons](/icons/react-icons/rich-icon-library) in your project by using the following syntax:

```tsx
import { AddIcon, ConversationRichIcon } from "@hopper-ui/icons";

<AddIcon />
<ConversationRichIcon />
```

#### Standalone Installation

It is recommended to use `@hopper-ui/icons` with `@hopper-ui/components`. The standalone installation procedure is detailed in case you only need the icons, and not the components. This is also the installation process until the components are released.

<PackageInstallation library="icons @hopper-ui/styled-system react-aria-components" mod="prod" />

Import the styles in your project:

```css
@import "@hopper-ui/icons/index.css";
@import "@hopper-ui/styled-system/index.css";
```

Configuring your application is a little different:

```tsx
import { StyledSystemProvider } from "@hopper-ui/styled-system";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!);

root.render(
    <StyledSystemProvider withBodyStyle colorScheme="light">
        <App />
    </StyledSystemProvider>
);
```

Using the icon is the exact same way as with the default package.

```tsx
import { AddIcon } from "@hopper-ui/icons";

<AddIcon />
```

#### React 16 Installation

If you're still using React 16, you need to use the `@hopper-ui/icons-react16` package.

<PackageInstallation library="icons-react16" mod="prod" />

The usage is the same as the default package, you only need to import the icons from a different package.

```tsx
import { AddIcon, ConversationRichIcon } from "@hopper-ui/icons-react16";

<AddIcon />
<ConversationRichIcon />
```
