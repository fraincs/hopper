This guide will help you get started with Hopper UI. Hopper UI is a Design System that provides a collection of components, tokens, and icons to help you build applications.

## Quick Install

To use Hopper in your project, run one of these commands in your terminal.

<PackageInstallation library="components @hopper-ui/icons @hopper-ui/tokens @hopper-ui/styled-system" mod="prod" />

After installing Hopper UI packages, you must setup a Provider at the root of your application. This is typically in your _index.tsx_ or _app.tsx_, but can vary based on your specific setup.

```jsx
import { HopperProvider } from "@hopper-ui/components";

<HopperProvider colorScheme="light">
    <Button>Hello World</Button>
</HopperProvider>
```

<Callout>Hopper is compatible with React 18. Not using React, or using an older version than 18? You can still benefit from Hopper, read on to discover how.</Callout>

## Detailed Installation

### Components

Hopper Components are React Comtponents, uf you are using another framework, or React Native, you should use the [components tokens](/tokens/getting-started/introduction) directly when developping your own components.

#### Installation

Run one of the following commands in your terminal to install the Hopper Components package.

<PackageInstallation library="components" mod="prod" />

#### Usage

A Provider is required to use Hopper Components. Wrap your application with the HopperProvider component to use our components.

```jsx
import { Button } from "@hopper-ui/components";

<HopperProvider theme="dark">
    <Button>Hello World</Button>
</HopperProvider>
```

### Tokens

Hopper Tokens are a collection of design tokens that should be used to style your application. [Semantic tokens](#) are available for everyone, where [components tokens](#) are designed with non React users in mind.

#### Installation

<PackageInstallation library="tokens" mod="prod" />

#### Usage

##### CSS

Import the tokens in your project by doing the following:

```css
@import "@hopper-ui/tokens/tokens.css";
```

If your application supports a dark mode, import dark mode tokens as well:

```css
@import "@hopper-ui/tokens/dark/tokens.css";
```

You can now use Hopper tokens in your project by using the following syntax:

```css
.my-class {
    background-color: var(--hop-primary-surface-weak);
}
```

##### Fonts

In order to use Hopper fonts in your project, import the following:

```css
@import "@hopper-ui/tokens/fonts.css";
```

All the necessary font-face declarations are now imported in your project.

### Icons

#### Installation

<PackageInstallation library="icons" mod="prod" />

#### Usage

You can now use [icons](/icons/react-icons/icon-library) and [rich icons](/icons/react-icons/rich-icon-library) in your project by using the following syntax:

```tsx
import { AddIcon } from "@hopper-ui/icons";
import { ConversationRichIcon } from "@hopper-ui/icons";

<AddIcon />
<ConversationRichIcon />
```

#### Non-standard installations

##### SVG Icons

If your project is not using the React framework, you can use the SVG icons directly. You can find the SVG icons in the `@hopper-ui/svg-icons` package.

<PackageInstallation library="svg-icons" mod="prod" />

You can import the SVG directly into your JavaScript file. Keep in mind that if you plan to use SVG icons as components, you'll need to ensure that your bundler is configured to handle SVG parsing appropriately.

```tsx
import alertIcon from "@hopper-ui/svg-icons/alert-24.svg";
```

Alternatively, you can utilize SVG icons within your CSS in the following manner:

```css
.myComponent {
    background-image: url("@hopper-ui/svg-icons/alert-24.svg");
}
```

##### React Icons Standalone Installation

It is recommended to use `@hopper-ui/icons` with `@hopper-ui/components`. The standalone installation procedure is detailed in case you only need the icons, and not the components. This is also the installation process until the components are released.

<PackageInstallation library="icons @hopper-ui/styled-system react-aria-components" mod="prod" />

Import the styles in your project:

```css
@import "@hopper-ui/icons/index.css";
@import "@hopper-ui/styled-system/index.css";
```

Configuring your application it a little different:

```tsx
import { StyledSystemProvider } from "@hopper-ui/styled-system";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!);

root.render(
    <StyledSystemProvider withBodyStyle colorScheme="light">
        <App />
    </StyledSystemProvider>
);
```

Using the icon is the exact same way as with the default package.

```tsx
import { AddIcon } from "@hopper-ui/icons";

<AddIcon />
```

##### React 16 Installation

If your'e still using React 16, you need to use the `@hopper-ui/icons-react16` package.

<PackageInstallation library="icons-react16" mod="prod" />

The usage is the same as the default package, you only need to import the icons from a different package.

```tsx
import { AddIcon } from "@hopper-ui/icons-react16";
import { ConversationRichIcon } from "@hopper-ui/icons-react16";

<AddIcon />
<ConversationRichIcon />
```
