### Composed Components

A `Form` uses the following components.

- [Label](./Label)
- [TextField](./TextField)
- [NumberField](./NumberField)
- [PasswordField](./PasswordField)
- [Button](./Button)
- [ButtonGroup](./ButtonGroup)
- [Helper Message](./HelperMessage)
- [Error Message](./ErrorMessage)

## Examples

### Disabled

A disabled form will not allow the user to interact with the form.

<Example src="Form/docs/disabled" />

### Validation

To provide validation errors, the `validationErrors` prop should be set to an object that maps each field's `name` prop
to a string or array of strings representing one or more errors. These are displayed to the user as soon as the
`validationErrors` prop is set, and cleared after the user modifies each field's value.

<Example src="Form/docs/validation" />

### Native Behavior validation

By default, native HTML form validation is used to display errors and block form submission. To instead use
native HTML form validation, set the `validationBehavior` prop to "native".

<Example src="Form/docs/nativeValidation" />

### Aria Behavior validation

By default, native HTML form validation is used to display errors and block form submission. To instead use
ARIA attributes for form validation, set the `validationBehavior` prop to "aria".
This will not block form submission, and will display validation errors to the user in realtime as the value is edited.

<Example src="Form/docs/ariaValidation" />

### Sizes

Form have multiple sizes to choose from.

<Example src="Form/docs/size" />
