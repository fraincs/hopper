title: Responsive Styles (WIP)
description: This page describes how Hopper style props accept a specialized syntax to support responsive breakpoints. These responsive properties help build adaptive user interfaces.

## Introduction

In addition to static values, all style props support object syntax to specify different values for the prop depending on the responsive breakpoint. Breakpoints are named following t-shirt sizing, and correspond to common device resolutions

In this example, the `Div` has a default background color, which is overriden at each breakpoint. Resize your browser window to see this in action.

{/* TODO: example and modify all the property values so it fits hopper */}
```tsx
<Div
    backgroundColor={{
        base: "moss-200",
        xs: "sapphire-200",
        sm: "moss-200",
        md: "sapphire-200",
        lg: "rock-200",
        xl: "sunken-treasure-200"
    }}
    width="30rem"
    maxWidth="100%"
    padding={160}
>
    <Text>Resize to see the background color change!</Text>
</Div>
```

## Breakpoints

There are five breakpoints available (+ the base), inspired by common device resolutions:

{/* TODO: do a table here */}
| Name | Minimum width |
| ---- | ------------- |
| base | 0px |
| xs | 640px |
| sm | 768px |
| md | 1024px |
| lg | 1280px |
| xl | 1440px |

## Working mobile-first

By default, Hopper uses a mobile-first breakpoint system, similar to what you might be used to in other frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind.

{/* TODO start the sentence with a <SuccessIcon /> */}
**Don't use `sm:` to target mobile devices**

{/* TODO: convert to example */}
```tsx
<Div
    // This will only center text on screens 768px and wider, not on small screens
    textAlign={{sm: "left"}}
    width="30rem"
    maxWidth="100%"
    padding={160}
>
    <Text>Text Content</Text>
</Div>
```

{/* TODO start the sentence with a <SuccessIcon /> */}
**Use `base` to target mobile, and override them at larger breakpoints**

{/* TODO: covnert to example */}
```tsx
<Div
    // This will center text on mobile, and left align it on screens 768px and wider
    textAlign={{base: "center", sm: "left"}}
    width="30rem"
    maxWidth="100%"
    padding={160}
>
    <Text>Text Content</Text>
</Div>
```

For this reason, it's often a good idea to implement the mobile layout for a design first, then layer on any changes that make sense for sm screens, followed by md screens, etc.

## Utility Methods

### useResponsiveValue

To resolve a responsive value within a React component, Hopper provides the useResponsiveValue hook.

{/* TODO example */}
```tsx
import { useResponsiveValue } from "@hopper-ui/components";

const isFluidValue = useResponsiveValue({ base: true, lg: false });
```
