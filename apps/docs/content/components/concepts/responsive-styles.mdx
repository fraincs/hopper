## Introduction

In addition to static values, all style props support object syntax to specify different values for the prop depending on the responsive breakpoint. Breakpoints are named following t-shirt sizing, and correspond to common device resolutions

In this example, the `Div` has a default background color, which is overridden at each breakpoint. Resize your browser window to see this in action.

## Breakpoints

There are five breakpoints available (+ the base), inspired by common device resolutions:
x
<BreakpointTable />

## Working mobile-first

By default, Hopper uses a mobile-first breakpoint system, similar to what you might be used to in other frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind.

{/* TODO start the sentence with a <ErrorIcon /> */}
**Don't use `sm:` to target mobile devices**

<Example src="HopperProvider/docs/responsive-styles/mobile-first-do-not" isOpen />


{/* TODO start the sentence with a <SuccessIcon /> */}
**Use `base` to target mobile, and override them at larger breakpoints**

<Example src="HopperProvider/docs/responsive-styles/mobile-first-do" isOpen />

For this reason, it's often a good idea to implement the mobile layout for a design first, then layer on any changes that make sense for sm screens, followed by md screens, etc.

## Utility Methods

### useResponsiveValue

To resolve a responsive value within a React component, Hopper provides the useResponsiveValue hook.
