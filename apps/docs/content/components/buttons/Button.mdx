## Props

<PropTable component="Button" />

## Examples

### Variants
A button can use different variants.

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/variant" />

**Primary** - For the principal call to action on the page. Primary buttons should only appear once per screen (not including the application header, modal or side panel).

**Secondary** - For secondary actions on each page. Secondary buttons can be used in conjunction with a primary button or on its own. Paired with a Primary button, the secondary button usually performs the negative action of the set, such as “Cancel.”

**Upsell** - For upsell actions that relates to upgrading an account or a plan. Use the upsell button to distinguish from an existing primary button. In some case a primary button can be used in its place when the general context of the page is about upselling.

**Danger** - For actions that could have destructive effects on the user’s data.

**Ghost-[primary|secondary|danger]** - For less prominent, and sometimes independent, actions. Ghost buttons can be used in isolation or paired with a primary button when there are multiple calls to action. Ghost buttons can also be used for sub-tasks on a
page where a primary button for the main and final action is present.

### Sizes
A button can vary in size.

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/size" />

### Disabled
A button can be disabled.

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/state" />

### Loading
A button can show a loading indicator. The button text is hidden but the button maintains the width that it would have if the text were visible.

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/loading" />

### Fluid
A button can be expanded to full width to fill its parent container.

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/layout" />

### Icon Only
A button can contain only an icon.

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/icon" />

### Icon
A button can contain icons.

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/icons" />

### End Icon
Non standard end icons can be provided to handle special cases. However, think twice before adding end icons, start icons should be your go to.

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/endIcon" />

### As Link
A button can be rendered as a link by using the href property.

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/asLink" />

### As Router Link
A button can be rendered as a react router link when using the href property, and setting the navigate property on the HopperProvider

<Example src="buttons/docs/button/reactRouterLink" />


### Advanced Customization

All Hopper Components exports a corresponding context that can be used to send props to them from a parent element.
You can send any prop or ref via context that you could pass to the corresponding component.
The local props and ref on the component are merged with the ones passed via context, with the local props taking precedence
